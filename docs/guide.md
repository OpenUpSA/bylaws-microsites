# Adding a By-law

Thanks for helping out! This project only works because our community members, people like you, help make it work.

We're going to take you through how to add a new by-law to Open By-laws website using the Indigo platform.

We're going to focus on the process of adding a new by-law. The process for **amending an existing by-law** is similar but has a few more details.

## Understanding the law

First, it's a good idea to have a rough understanding of how laws and by-laws work in South Africa. The Indigo documentation has an good [Introduction to the terminology of law](http://indigo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/law-intro.html) prepared by Adrienne Pretorius, a legal editor with many ears of experience.

It doesn't take long to read through and the ideas are straight-forward. In particular, please ensure you understand:

* [Publications of Acts](http://indigo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/law-intro.html#publication-of-acts)
* [Components of an Act](http://indigo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/law-intro.html#components-parts-of-an-act)

## Finding a document to import

Thankfully you don't need to re-type the entire by-law. Indigo can import text from PDFs, Word and RTF documents, among others. You need to find
an existing version of the by-law to import.

When looking for a by-law to import, keep these guidelines in mind:

* it's not official unless it's published in a Gazette
* a version from an official source, such as a published Gazette, is best
* don't use a draft version; small, important details can change
* if you have a scanned document, you'll need to OCR it to convert it to text

Municipalities must make their by-laws available to the public. Most do so on their websites, although they're often
out of date or incomplete. They're a good start.

## Importing the document

Once you've got your document, you can import it into Indigo.

* Log into your account on [indigo.openbylaws.org.za](https://indigo.openbylaws.org.za)
* In the Library view, click **New > Import a document**
* Drag and drop your file into the box (or click the **Choose a file** button)
* If you need to, tell Indigo how the section titles of your document are formatted.
* Click **Import document**

Indigo will take a few minutes to do the hard work of importing your document.

Once it's done, it'll show you your newly imported document. Next up is telling Indigo more about what you
just imported.

## Metadata: titles, dates, etc.

* title
* country, locality, etc.
* publication date
* year
* short name
* gazette
